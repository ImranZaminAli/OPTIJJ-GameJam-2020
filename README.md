OPTIJJ GameJam 2020

This was a university competition in which we had 24 hours to create a game. The theme was 'keep going forwards' which my team interpreted at the inability to move backwards. There are a series of rooms where enemies are trying to attack you. Your task is to get to the door at the opposite side of the room which needs to be opened by standing of all the pressure plates. If you miss one you will inevitably lose becuase you cannot go back. At the end there is a boss room which can only be accessed by completing some logic puzzles.
